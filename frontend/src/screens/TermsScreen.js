					develop a web application for the client. All call bookings are
					obligation free and are of no cost to the client. Neither party is

					Project proposal
				</Typography>
				<Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
					If both the client and Apex Apps agree to move forward with
					development, a project proposal will be sent by Apex Apps to the
					client via email. This document will detail the approximate structure
					of the proposed project, as well as early conceptual renderings of
					color schemes, layouts, and other design elements. The features of the
					website will also be clearly outlined, including any limitations or
					restrictions.

					Project agreement
				</Typography>
				<Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
					The project proposal will also contain a project agreement, outlining
					the project details, an estimated development time frame, and payment
					terms. A percentage of the total price of the project is usually
					required as a non-refundable deposit before development commences. The
					remaining balance is to be paid at the completion of development once
					the project has been completed and deployed. The project agreement
					must be signed by both parties before development commences.

				<Typography variant='h3' className={classes.subtitle3}>
					Project amendments
				</Typography>
				<Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
					Any changes to the design, layout, structure, functionality or
					features of the web application must be communicated and agreed upon
					between both parties. If the change will alter the development
					timeframe or payment terms, a new project proposal will be sent to the
					client. An additional fee may be included for this amendment. The new
					project agreement will replace and nullify the existing agreement.

					password to access this page will be sent to the clientâ€™s email soon
					after development has begun. The project progress page will outline
					the key milestones of the project and the estimated timeline for these
					milestones to be completed. As each milestone is completed, the time,
					date and details of the milestone will be displayed on the project
					progress page, and included in a milestone email sent to the client.
					The client may opt out of receiving milestone emails at any time.
